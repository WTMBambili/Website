# Women Techmakers - Bambili Website
# The building of this website will go on as follows
    1) There will be 5 teams ( 4 shall work on the content and sections of the website and 1 will work on the Documentation )
    2) Programming languages used will be HTML, Javascript and CSS
# In order to contribute, 

    Fork the repository 
    Create a feature branch like "feature_hawa"
    After making the changes, push to Github and then open a Pull request 
    #my own branch


  Considering the fact that we are numerous and the workload is small, to ease the contribution we will proceed as follows:
  - The group lead of each group creates a branch e.g `git checkout -b feature/name_of_section`. name_of_section corresponding to the section of the website the group is working on.
  - She makes some changes(create an index.html file), commit it and opens a pull request.
  - Her group members then pull the code from the wtm repository, switch to the feature/name_of_section branch with the command `git checkout feature/name_of_section`, create their own files and make the changes they have to and push them with a screenshot of the output.
  - The group leader then reviews the code, copy and paste it in her own code at the appropriate position the cleans up the branch by deleting the members' files
